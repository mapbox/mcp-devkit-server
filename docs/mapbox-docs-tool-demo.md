- Fragmented results from multiple sources
- Potential inaccuracies from third-party sites
- Missing new APIs or changes

### After (using get_latest_mapbox_docs_tool):

- ‚úÖ Always current official information
- ‚úÖ Complete ecosystem overview
- ‚úÖ Authoritative source (directly from Mapbox)
- ‚úÖ Includes latest APIs and features

## üéõ Advanced Usage

### Complex Project Planning

```
I need to architect a complete geospatial solution with mapping, search, routing, and analytics. Based on the latest Mapbox offerings, what would be the optimal combination of services?
```

### Competitive Analysis
